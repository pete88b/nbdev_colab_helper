    " \n",
    "As you can see from [this notebook](https://github.com/pete88b/nbdev_colab_helper/blob/master/00_core.ipynb), you don't have to `!pip install nbdev` in every notebook.\n",

    "## The colab helper notebook\n",
    " \n",
    "Having a colab helper notebook gives you a place to do the things you would do from the command line in a non-colab environment (like running nbdev or git commands).
